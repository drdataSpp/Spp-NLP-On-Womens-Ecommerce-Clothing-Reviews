# NLP & Text Mining On Womens Ecommerce Clothing Reviews
This repository has R Scripts in which I have performed NLP and Text Mining on Womenâ€™s Clothing E-Commerce dataset revolving around the reviews written by customers.  

## How the analysis was performed?
- The orginal dataset was split into two subsets namely: Positive reviews and Negative Reviews.
- This subsets were used to perform NLP and Text Mining seperately to extract insights. 
- **The main purpose** of this project is to build a word cloud to understand what are the most used words while classifying a cloth as a good or a bad one.

## How an executive is benefited here?
The Executive can note the most frequent terms/ words in the negative reviews word cloud and improve the clothing based on those factors, for example, he or she could work on improving the quality of the fabric and material of the cloth to imporve customer satisfaction.
